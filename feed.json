The number of possible areas that can be customized will depend on the theme, but generally you should expect to at least find a <strong>Primary Color</strong> option, which sets the main color for the key elements in the theme. Beyond this, you are likely to find color options for secondary elements, on-hover text link colors, plus heading, text or link colors.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
